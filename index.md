## MobilePush SDK: Important Forward-Compatibility Statement

In the January, 2020 Marketing Cloud MobilePush SDK release, support for older Android and iOS versions was removed from the SDK.

* Android requires a minimum API version of 21.
* iOS requires a minimum deployment target of 10.0

Existing mobile applications will continue to function, without change.  Mobile applications may continue to reference older SDK versions, without change.  Applications which adopt the January, 2020 MobilePush SDK release may require a project change if your application build still supports an older value (Android: earlier than API 21, iOS: iOS 9).

Additionally, the October, 2021 Android MobilePush SDK will release with the following changes:
1. Usage of Android Support libraries will migrate to the androidx-packaged library artifacts.
   * If your application still depends on the old support packaging you can enable jetifier to continue using the SDK by adding the following to our project's `gradle.properties` file.
        ```groovy
      android.userAndroidX=true
      android.enableJetifier=true
        ```
1. Java 8 source compatibility.
2. New dependency on the Kotlin std-lib.
3. Small changes to the API to better align with expected method naming in Kotlin.

## Android T

Support for Android T was added in the version 8.0.7 of the SDK.  See the [Releases]({{site.baseurl}}/#releases) section for more details.

## Get Started

Integrate MobilePush into your mobile app using the SFMCSdk:

1. Provision your app with [Google]({{ site.baseurl }}/provisioning/google.html).
1. [Create your app]({{ site.baseurl }}/create-apps/create-apps-overview.html) in MobilePush.
1. [Download the SDK and implement it for Google]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/implement-sdk-google.html). Add the SDK repository URL and dependency to your build script. The SDK is downloaded when you run the build.
1. Test your push messages.
    * Create a [test audience](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_mp_create_an_audience.htm&type=5).
    * Create a [test message](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_mp_outbound_message.htm&type=5) in the Marketing Cloud MobilePush app.
1. Implement additional optional features of the SDK to take full advantage of Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
    * Use a [contact key]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/device-contact-registration.html#contact-key) to set the unique identifier used to aggregate a contact's devices within Marketing Cloud. Set the contact key to a specific value provided by your customer or to another unique identifier for the contact, such as mobile number, email address, customer number, or another value.
    * Add [attributes]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/device-contact-registration.html#attributes) and [tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/device-contact-registration.html#tags) -- Enhance your ability to segment your push message audiences.
    * Add [predictive intelligence]({{ site.baseurl }}/analytics/analytics.html) using Einstein Recommendations -- Track cart and cart conversions. Purchase this feature separately.
    * Add other features -- Send push notifications along with your [inbox messages]({{ site.baseurl }}/inbox/inbox.html) and trigger location-based messages with [location and beacon messaging]({{ site.baseurl }}/location/geolocation-overview.html).
