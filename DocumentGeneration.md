Generating JavaDoc in Android Studio

In order to generate the JavaDoc, when coding you have to write doc comments for the JavaDoc tool (more info  

[here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html)).

When your comments are ready, follow this steps to automatically generate the documentation:

1. In Android Studio, go to **Tools** -> **Generate JavaDocâ€¦**

2. In **Other command line arguments** enter: 

-bootclasspath /Users/admin/Library/Android/sdk/platforms/android-22/android.jar (substitute this path with the appropriate one).

3. Configure as wished.

4. Choose an output directory and click **ok**.

The documents will been saved in the output directory. To see them, open the index.html in the output directory.
