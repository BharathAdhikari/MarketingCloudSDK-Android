The Sdk uses the location capabilities of your device to trigger location based notifications. The SDK caches Geofence messages and displays those messages when a mobile device crosses a Geofence boundary. You must receive user permission to implement location services.

Note that the Marketing Cloud must enable your account with access to MobilePush and Location Services in order to successfully use this functionality.
