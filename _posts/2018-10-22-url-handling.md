The SDK doesn't automatically present URLs from these sources.

* CloudPage URLs from push notifications
* OpenDirect URLs from push notifications
* Action URLs from in-app messages

To handle URLs from push notifications, see [Customize Notification Handling]({{ site.baseurl }}/notifications/customize-notifications.html).  To handle URLs from in-app messages, see [In-App Messaging (Required Methods)]({{ site.baseurl }}/in-app-message/in-app-messaging.html#required-methods)
