Use the SDK to easily incorporate inbox functionality into your mobile app. All active inbox messages download to the mobile device each time the app is brought to the foreground.

Marketers can create an `Inbox Only` message to deliver the message silently to the inbox or an `Inbox+Alert` message to include a push notification with the inbox message.

Find convenience methods for refreshing the inbox and getting, reading, and deleting messages in the [InboxMessageManager]({{ site.baseurl}}/javadocs/{{ site.currentMajorMinor }}/reference/com/salesforce/marketingcloud/messages/inbox/InboxMessageManager.html).

### Use Case
#### Sort Inbox Messages by Sent Date
To sort inbox messages in your custom inbox implementation, use the value of `sendDateUtc`  from the inbox message returned by `getMessages` and other getters.
