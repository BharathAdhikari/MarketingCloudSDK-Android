* **Prevent crash on Android O or newer**-Some devices running Android O, or newer can exhibit a bug where the SDK will attempt to create a job using Android's JobScheduler when there are already 100 scheduled jobs.  This would result in Android throwing an IllegalStateException.  We added code to prevent this crash and improve logging when the issue occurs.
