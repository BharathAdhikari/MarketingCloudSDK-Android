* **Required app endpoint (tenant-specific endpoint)**—To pass the SDK's configuration, an app endpoint is now required. [Find the app endpoint](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_mp_provisioning_info.htm&type=5#mc_mp_provisioning_info) for your app under Administration in MobilePush. Review [Configuration Requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/create-apps/create-apps-overview.html#configuration_requirements) for details.
* **Enforced critical update to Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android SDK**—For your app to continue receiving messages, you must update your SDK to version 6.0.1 or later and [configure your app with Firebase initialized]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/implement-sdk-google.html).
* **Added ability to delay registration until contact key is set**—Use a new SDK configuration value to delay registrations to Marketing Cloud until a contact key is set via [`setDelayRegistrationUntilContactKeyIsSet()`]({{ site.baseurl }}/javadocs/6.2/reference/com/salesforce/marketingcloud/MarketingCloudConfig.Builder.html#setDelayRegistrationUntilContactKeyIsSet(boolean)). Review [Delay Registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/device-contact-registration.html#delay-registration-until-contact-key-is-set) for details.
* **Inbox messages support `sendDateUtc` for sorting**—Inbox messages delivered to your app now include the date that the message was sent. App users can sort their inbox based on this value. Review [Inbox]({{ site.baseurl }}/inbox/inbox.html) for more information.
* **Added ability to set read or deleted by inbox message ID only**—Added convenience methods to set the status of an inbox message to read or deleted with only the message's ID as an argument.
