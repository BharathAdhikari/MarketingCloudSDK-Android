* **Corrected Registration Frequency Issue** -- We corrected an issue in the SDK that would allow for multiple registration requests to be sent to the Marketing Cloud within a small amount of time.  Now, registration edits will be properly batched and sent once per minute.
* **Improved SdkState Logging** -- To improve our ability to support you during debugging sessions we have improved the SDK state output.
