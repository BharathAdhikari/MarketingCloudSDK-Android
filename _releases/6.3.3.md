* **Deliver in-app messages**-Deliver relevant, personalized messages to your appâ€™s users. You can now send messages without relying on users having enabled push notifications. Engaging full-screen, modal, or banner messages are presented while your users are interacting with your app. See [In-App Messaging]({{ site.baseurl }}/in-app-message/in-app-messaging.html) for more.
* **Improved database recovery**-Rarely, the database used by the SDK becomes corrupt. To resolve any issues before initialization is complete, we added code to validate the database and its structure during initialization.
* **Fixed rare system bug**-Certain Android devices and versions can cause issues when modifying the message data associated with a notification's PendingIntent. To avoid these issues, we changed the structure of the data stored in the PendingIntent.
