* **Deliver in-app messages**-Deliver relevant, personalized messages to your appâ€™s users. You can now send messages without relying on users having enabled push notifications. Engaging full-screen, modal, or banner messages are presented while your users are interacting with your app. See [In-App Messaging]({{ site.baseurl }}/in-app-message/in-app-messaging.html) for more.
* **Database recovery improvements** - In rare occasions, the database used by the SDK can become corrupt.  We have added code to validate the database and its structure during initialization.  Any issues encountered will be resolved before initialization completes.
* **Fixed rare system bug** - Certain devices/versions of Android have been known to cause issues trying to modify the message data associated with a Notification's PendingIntent.  This fix changes the structure of the data stored in the PendingIntent to avoid these issues.
